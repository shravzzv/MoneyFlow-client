Prioritize essential expenses such as housing, utilities, and food while looking for areas where you can cut back on discretionary spending, like dining out or entertainment subscriptions. Since your expenses currently exceed your income, consider ways to increase your income, such as taking on freelance work or part-time jobs. Additionally, set up an emergency fund with at least three to six months' worth of living expenses to cushion against unforeseen circumstances, and consider speaking to a financial advisor for personalized strategies. Regularly review your budget and financial goals to ensure you stay on track, and utilize financial apps to monitor your spending in real-time.",
